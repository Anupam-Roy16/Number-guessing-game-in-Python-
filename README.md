# Number-guessing-game-in-Python-
Some random integer will be selected by the system and the user has to guess that integer in the minimum number of guesses.The minimum number of guesses depends upon range. And the compiler must calculate the minimum number of guessing depends upon the range, on its own. For this, we have a formula:-

 Minimum number of guessing = log2(Upper bound â€“ lower bound + 1)
